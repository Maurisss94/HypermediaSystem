<h3>What is that?</h3>

The Macintosh ( branded as Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by
Apple Inc. Steve Jobs introduced the original Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This was the company's first
mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. This first model was later
renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also
based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor
of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the development of the first model.
