<h3>New features:</h3>


<b>- The Start Menu</b>
<p>Windows 8 made the hugely controversial move to eliminate the Start Menu, opting instead for a full screen. It went over about as well as you’d expect. In Windows 10, however, the Start Menu is back. Now, is here just like regular app icons, in (relatively) perfect harmony.</p>

<b>- Cortana</b>
<p>As if bringing the Start Menu back weren’t enough, Microsoft has built its personal voice assistant Cortana right in. Even if you’re already using Google Now or Siri, having Cortana on your desktop can be handy. You can perform web searches to get many of the same quick answers by simply pressing the Win key and typing a question like “How many ounces are in a cup” or “What’s the weather like?”</p>

<b>- Microsoft Edge</b>
<p>Now, with Windows 10, Microsoft is ditching the old browser (Internet explorer) for Microsoft Edge. We’ve already taken a look at the browser and, while it’s still pretty bare bones, it has several unique features including a text-only reader mode, an annotation tool, and even Cortana integration.</p>

<b>- Multiple Desktops</b>
<p>Being able to run a few apps at once is the great benefit of an operating system like Windows. Running too many, though, can get overwhelming. Now, Microsoft is finally adding the ability to create and manage multiple desktops. You can add new desktops, quickly move windows between them, and jump between desktops by pressing Win-Tab</p>
