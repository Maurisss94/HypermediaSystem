<p>
    Windows Server is a brand name for a group of server operating systems released by Microsoft. It includes all
    Windows operating systems branded "Windows Server", but not any other Microsoft product. The first Windows server
    edition to be released under that brand was Windows Server 2003

<h3>New features:</h3>
Physical and virtual machines benefit from greater time accuracy due to improvements in the Win32 Time and Hyper-V Time Synchronization Services.
Windows Server can now host services that are compliant with upcoming regulations which require a 1ms accuracy with regards to UTC.
<b>Nano Server</b>
<p>
    Nano Server boasts a 92 percent smaller installation footprint than the Windows Server graphical user interface
    (GUI) installation option. Beyond just that, these compelling reasons may make you start running Nano for at least
    some of your Windows Server workloads
</p>
<b>Containers</b>
<p>
    Microsoft is working closely with the Docker development team to bring Docker-based containers to Windows Server.
    Until now, containers have existed almost entirely in the Linux/UNIX open-source world.
</p>
<b>
    Linux Secure Boot
</b>
<p>
    Secure Boot is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification that protects a server's
    startup environment against the injection of rootkits or other assorted boot-time malware.
