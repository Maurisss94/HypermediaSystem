<p>
    Apart from having Windows as an operating system in personal computers, mobile and servers there are many more
    types of devices with windows incorporated, let's see some examples
</p>
<h3>Microsoft Band 2</h3>
<p>
    Microsoft Band was a smart band with smartwatch and activity tracker/fitness tracker features, created and
    developed by Microsoft. It was announced on October 29, 2014. The Microsoft Band incorporated fitness tracking and
    health-oriented capabilities and integrated with Windows Phone, iOS, and Android smartphones through a Bluetooth
    connection. On October 3, 2016, Microsoft stopped sales and development of the line of devices.
</p>

<h3>Windows Store</h3>
<p>
    Microsoft Store (formerly Windows Store, before October 2017) is a digital distribution platform for Microsoft
    Windows. It started as an app store for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 as the primary means of distributing
    Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

<h3>Fridge with Windows 10</h3>
<p>Last year, Samsung embedded a giant tablet in the front of a fridge and called the fridge smart. People kind of
    bought it, and there was much hype. This year Samsung is hoping that some software updates to that fridge tech will
    set it apart. But it wonâ€™t. Instead, the Samsung smart fridge must suffer. Because LG one-upped Samsung and made Windows refrigerators.</p>
