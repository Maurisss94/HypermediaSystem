It’s incredible to see how Linux runs on devices of various sizes, power and built for diverse purposes. Linux is, like technology itself, deeply integrated in our daily lives and we don’t seem to even realize it! While looking into supercomputers I was pleasantly surprised to find different/weird devices that run on Linux: Weird, in a sense that they run on Linux and we never expected them to do so!

We expect that you already know that Linux is running on 94% supercomputers and on various high-end computers and devices in science centers for research purposes. Also the popular Android operating system too is based on Linux kernel. 
<br> <br>This implies all the Android handsets (currently claiming major share in smartphone market) and tablets are in turn employing Linux at heart! Now let’s investigate some places you might not have expected to be running on Linux.

                    </header>
                    <p>Cadillac XTS 2013, launched this year back in May employs what it calls a game-changing infotainment intender known as the Cadillac User Experience (CUE) for recognizing voice. A more interesting feature is perhaps the integration of local searches. You can sit in your new car and simply command the car to take you to a place where they serve (let’s say) hot chocolate, all you need to do is to say “I want to have hot chocolate”! Also the advance CUE system has versatile music players that can play a song, tune on radio etc with your voice command! And not to forget, the whole system runs on Linux. </p>

                    <p>Large Hadron Collider is by far the most powerful physics project in the history of the known universe starting functioning in 2008. The large Hadron Collider took over 20 years to build and the hard work of half of all the world’s astrophysicists. The $10 Billion Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is powered by Linux.</p>

                    <p>Last year San Francisco deployed a completely new Linux-based traffic controller computer that meets the latest Advanced Transportation Controller (ATC) standards. The system is built around an advance Freescale PowerQUICC II Pro processor, the “2070LXN2 NEMA” offers several keypads, an 8×40 display, plus Ethernet, USB, serial, and SDLC connections. Linux is used in the system as it enables an open architecture system, as well as a more robust, flexible, and expandable platform that is compatible with multi-vendor application control software.</p>
