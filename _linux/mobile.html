Everyone knows Android. Is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input.
<br>
In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras, PCs and other electronics.

Android is not the only Linux-based operating system for mobile devices
<br>
<br>
Sick of Android? Don’t want to be part of a proprietary ecosystem? Security and privacy are becoming increasingly important for smartphone users, but what is the answer? For some, abandoning Android and switching to a phone that can run a Linux mobile operating system is the answer.
<br><br>
With security improvements and a better attitude towards privacy and open source, Linux smartphone operating systems are available. They’re just not particularly well known. (Although Android is based on the Linux kernel, it cannot really be considered Linux.)
<br>
Here are three Linux smartphone operating systems that are available to install today.

                    <p>It's probably the best-known operating system for mobile devices. <br> Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Beginning with the first commercial Android device in September 2008, the operating system has gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being 8.0 "Oreo", released in August 2017.</p>

                    <p>Ubuntu Touch’s approach to smartphones is intelligent, dealing with the lack of apps by providing much of the data usually found in apps natively. This is done in the guise of Scopes, different pages of the Home screen that provide customized news, weather, apps, and social networks. It works well, too, although there is always a time when apps are needed.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most exciting option on the table is Plasma Mobile, a smartphone-focused spin on the popular Plasma. Having gained a lot of attention during 2017 (mostly due to Ubuntu abandoning Ubuntu Touch), Plasma Mobile’s aim is to become a “complete and open software system for mobile devices.”</p>
