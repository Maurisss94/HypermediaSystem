Linux distributions have long been used as server operating systems, and have risen to prominence in that area; Netcraft reported in September 2006, that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their web servers. In June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten, FreeBSD three of ten, and Microsoft two of ten since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, FreeBSD two of ten, and Microsoft one of ten.
<br>Linux operating systems are exceptionally prevalent and wide-ranging. While certain Linux distros are suitable for power users, others are simpler, and perfect for switching from Windows. Linux distributions often benefit from strong community resources.
<br>
Although the Linux operating systems offer excellent desktop environments, Linux can be excellent for server set ups as well. Linux typically offers enhanced permissions, increased flexibility, and stability.

What differentiates a Linux server operating system from a general Linux distribution? Consider server hardware. Servers are essentially computers with specialized specifications. For instance, server hardware ensures maximum uptime, efficiency, and security. Additionally, servers balance computing power with power consumption. Similarly, Linux server operating systems prioritize security and resource consumption.
<br>
<br>
A Linux server operating system serves content to client devices. Accordingly, server operating systems feature tools for simple server creation. Because servers commonly run headless, the graphical user interface (GUI) in a Linux server operating system remains less important.
<br>
<br>
According to IDC, hardware sales data indicates that 28 percent of servers are Linux-based. However this likely doesn’t account for home labbers. While there are dedicated Linux server operating systems, you may roll your own. The key here is to use a Long Term Service (LTS) iteration and install your desired software. LTS flavors provide stability and a longer support cycle.

                    <p>Ubuntu is arguably the most well-known Linux operating system. With a plethora of Ubuntu derivatives, it’s a stable distribution. Ubuntu and its variants offer excellent user experiences. Ubuntu Server is available in two versions: LTS and a rolling-release. The LTS Ubuntu Server release boasts a five year support cycle. Although the support cycle isn’t five years, the non-LTS variant features nine months of security and maintenance updates.</p>
