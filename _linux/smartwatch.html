Wearable tech, in its many shapes and forms, changes human-machine interaction. The technology squeezes cutting-edge features — like voice activation, biometrics and gesture controls — into devices streamlined to fit the human body. But the hardware and aesthetics don’t enable wearables, it’s the operating system (OS). The OS provides every salient feature of all smart-pants, watches and gloves. It should shock readers that wearable-everything suffers from serious hardware issues.
<br>
The most important component of wearable operating systems: The kernel. It sits between the software of your technology and the hardware. It determines how hardware solves various software tasks, power management and more.

{% contentfor section2 %}
Each kernel works with a specific range of hardware. For example, Google Wear works with the same hardware as Linux — that’s because Android Wear steals its hardware compatibility from the Linux kernel. 
<br>
<br>
Android Wear is not the only operating system for wearables. Below are other examples of Linux-based operating systems.

                    <p>Android Wear is a version of Google's Android operating system designed for smartwatches and other wearables.By pairing with mobile phones running Android version 4.3 or newer, or iOS version 8.2 or newer with limited support from Google's pairing application, Android Wear integrates Google Assistant technology and mobile notifications into a smartwatch form factor. It also adds the ability to download applications from the Google Play Store.</p>

                    <p>Tizen OS is developed by Intel, Vodafone, Orange, Samsung. The lightweight version of this operating system is called: Tizen for Wearable and is led by Samsung, who happens to also develop Android Wear smartwatches. Tizen for Wearables is an open source OS and can run standalone apps (without any connection to a host app on a smartphone) which is quite unique for wearable operating systems, it can also run integrated apps and linked apps.</p>
