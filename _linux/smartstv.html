{% contentfor section1 %}
All smart TVs and smart TV devices are like mini computers, in that they include a built-in OS and the appropriate software or middleware to run the necessary apps. Now, these devices don’t run a full-blown consumer OS, such as Windows, but rather smaller, more stripped down OS’s developed specifically for these purposes.

{% contentfor section2 %}
There are a number of smart TV OS’s in use today, many proprietary to a specific company or device. These include the following:

                    <p>Android TV is a smart TV platform developed by Google. Based on the Android operating system, it creates an interactive television experience through a 10-foot user interface. It was initially announced on June 25, 2014, at Google I/O 2014 as a successor to Google's earlier attempt at a smart TV platform, which was Google TV.
                        
                        Android TV can be built both into TVs and into stand-alone digital media players. Users have access to the Google Play Store to download Android apps, including media streaming services Netflix and Hulu, as well as games.</p>

                    <p>Firefox OS was developed by Mozilla, which is best known for the Firefox web browser. Work started in 2012 and the company had grand plans for Firefox OS, which is based on a web browser core, for the mobile space. Those plans were abandoned in late 2015 but Mozilla assured everyone that it would continue development on Firefox OS for TVs. Now, about half a year later, the company has also pulled the power cord on TVs. The code will be releases as open source.</p>
